<blockquote>Welcome to <b>Sydney McKenna's</b> page!! </blockquote>
<h2> Myself </h2>
<ol>
  <li>I'm Sydney McKenna, a senior Digital and Screen Media Major in the CIS Program <br>
    and a Data Science Minor.</li>
  <li> I'm taking this course to help build a website for my Thesis
    on Facebook <br>
    and my goals are to learn how to properly code HTML,
  as well as learn how to code a website. </li>
</ol>
<h2> Inspirational Website Projects </h2>
<a href="https://art111.sydmckenna.com/">
  My Personal Project from Art 111<br> </a>
<ul>
  <li> I love the website I made through my Davidson Domain, and <br>
    want to get at this point with HTML Coding. </li>
  <li>  The colors, fonts,and easy accessibility to projects is what I love.</li>
  <li> I also love the fact that I made this myself without HTML, so <br>
    let's see if I can do this with HTML! I definetly like this more for <br>
    its artistic side over anything else.</li>
</ul>

  Facebook Profile <br></a>
<ul>
  <li> Personally, my personal profile on Facebook organizationally looks pleasing <br>
    to the eye of the user.  Having these consitent blocks and everything need and <br>
    orderly, it's simplistic to navigate.
  <li> For facebook being my main source of concentration this semester in my classes, <br>
    I want to better understand these methods to make websites need and tidy.</li>
  <li> I also want to grasp the simplistic measures Facebook Profiles and feeds have <br>
    to offer. </li>
</ul>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/">
  Apple <br></a>
<ul>
  <li>Growing up with Apple products, I have learned to love the sleek and almost cultural <br>
    experience it is to go on their website. </li>
  <li> I personally think this project is amazing due to the experience every user has <br>
    when using the site.  It lures people in to want to buy another expensive product. </li>
  <li> The color scheme also is one that I personally love looking at.  Every pop of color <br>
    and every HD picture makes users want to keep exploring.  I want to have that kind of <br>
    outlook and design on my site, seen as how I love photography and design. </li>
</ul>
